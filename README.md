## Usage Examples

### Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm run preview

# Run tests
npm run test        # Interactive test runner
npm run test:run    # Run once and exit
npm run test:ui     # Test UI interface
```

### Example API Usage

The app includes a Top Deals API for programmatic access:

```javascript
// Get top deals with default settings
const response = await fetch('/api/top-deals');
const data = await response.json();

// Get deals with custom filters
const filteredDeals = await fetch('/api/top-deals?minScore=25&searchTerms=Spider-Man,X-Men');
```

### Using the JavaScript Function Directly

```typescript
import { getTopDeals } from './src/lib/topDeals';

// Get top deals with defaults
const deals = await getTopDeals();

// Custom filtering
const highValueDeals = await getTopDeals(25, ['Amazing Spider-Man', 'X-Men']);

console.log(`Found ${deals.length} deals`);
deals.forEach(deal => {
  console.log(`${deal.listing.title}: ${deal.dealScore.score}% (Â£${deal.listing.totalPriceGBP})`);
});
```

## Project Structure

```
/public/          # Static assets
/src/
  /components/    # Reusable UI components
  /pages/         # Page components (Home, ItemDetail, Alerts)
  /lib/           # Utility functions and business logic
  /data/          # Mock data fixtures for development
  /hooks/         # Custom React hooks
  /__tests__/     # Test files
  /styles/        # CSS and design system
```

## Testing with Fixtures

ComicScout uses comprehensive fixture data for development and testing. The test data is located in `/src/data/fixtures.json` and includes:

### Fixture Data Structure

```json
{
  "series": [
    {
      "seriesId": "amazing-spider-man-1963",
      "title": "The Amazing Spider-Man",
      "publisher": "Marvel Comics", 
      "startYear": 1963,
      "aliases": ["asm", "amazing spider-man"]
    }
  ],
  "issues": [
    {
      "issueId": "amazing-spider-man-1963-300",
      "seriesId": "amazing-spider-man-1963",
      "issueNumber": "300",
      "keyNotes": "First appearance of Venom"
    }
  ],
  "grades": [...],
  "marketValues": [...],
  "listings": [...],
  "dealScores": [...]
}
```

### Using Fixtures in Tests

```typescript
// Example test using fixtures
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { parseTitle } from '../lib/normaliser';

describe('Title Parser', () => {
  it('should parse Amazing Spider-Man correctly', () => {
    const result = parseTitle('Amazing Spider-Man #300 CGC 9.8');
    expect(result.seriesId).toBe('amazing-spider-man-1963');
    expect(result.issueNumber).toBe('300');
    expect(result.grade).toBe('cgc-9-8-nm-mt');
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with UI interface  
npm run test:ui

# Run tests once (for CI)
npm run test:run

# Run specific test file
npm run test normaliser
```

The fixture data includes:
- **Comic Series**: Amazing Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Iron Man
- **Key Issues**: First appearances, milestone issues with market data
- **Grading Systems**: CGC grades (9.8, 9.4, etc.) and raw conditions
- **Market Values**: Historical pricing data for value calculations
- **Deal Scores**: Sample scoring data for algorithm testing
- **Alert Rules**: Example alert configurations

**Important**: This is mock data for development and testing only. Production deployment would require real market data integration.

## Branching and PR Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention

- **Feature branches**: `feature/description-of-feature`
- **Bug fixes**: `bugfix/description-of-fix`
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
- **Documentation**: `docs/description-of-changes`

### Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes with Tests**
   - Write/update tests for your changes
   - Ensure all tests pass: `npm run test:run`
   - Check code quality: `npm run lint`
   - Verify build works: `npm run build`

3. **Commit Standards**
   ```bash
   # Use conventional commit format
   git commit -m "feat: add new deal scoring algorithm"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve parsing issue with variant covers"
   git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
   ```

4. **Pull Request Guidelines**
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive summary
   - **Description**: Include:
     - What changes were made and why
     - Testing performed
     - Screenshots for UI changes
     - Breaking changes (if any)
   - **Checklist**:
     - [ ] Tests pass (`npm run test:run`)
     - [ ] Code lints cleanly (`npm run lint`)
     - [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
     - [ ] Documentation updated if needed

### Code Review Process

- PRs require at least one reviewer
- All automated checks must pass
- Address feedback before merging
- Use "Squash and merge" for clean history

### Quality Gates

Before merging, ensure:
```bash
# All tests pass
npm run test:run

# No linting errors
npm run lint

# Successful build
npm run build

# Check for type errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```
