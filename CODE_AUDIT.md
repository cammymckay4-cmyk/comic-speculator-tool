## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Strong type definitions in `src/lib/types.ts`
   - Comprehensive interfaces for domain models
   - Good separation of concerns between data models

2. **Component Architecture**  
   - Modern functional components with hooks
   - Proper separation between UI components (`components/ui/`) and business components
   - Good use of composition patterns

3. **Business Logic Separation**
   - Core algorithms isolated in dedicated modules (`dealScore.ts`, `normaliser.ts`)
   - Clear domain boundaries following DDD principles
   - Well-defined interfaces between layers

4. **Development Tooling**
   - Modern build setup with Vite
   - ESLint configuration for code quality
   - Vitest for testing with good test coverage setup

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Code Consistency and Standards

**Severity: Medium**

- **Issue:** Inconsistent coding patterns across files
- **Examples:**
  - Mix of function declarations and arrow functions
  - Inconsistent import ordering and grouping
  - Variable naming conventions not strictly followed
- **Recommendation:** Implement Prettier with strict rules, standardize on arrow functions for components, establish import ordering conventions

#### 2. Error Handling

**Severity: High**

- **Issue:** Inconsistent error handling patterns
- **Examples:**
  - `ebayClient.ts:65-66` - Returns empty array on error without logging context
  - `normaliser.ts:201-209` - Low confidence parsing falls back to defaults without proper error reporting
  - API error handling not standardized
- **Recommendation:** Implement centralized error handling strategy, consistent logging, and proper error boundaries for React components

#### 3. Magic Numbers and Configuration

**Severity: Medium**

- **Issue:** Hard-coded values throughout codebase
- **Examples:**
  - `dealScore.ts:67` - Sample count threshold `< 5` hard-coded
  - `normaliser.ts:201` - Confidence threshold `< 0.4` hard-coded  
  - Various timeout values and thresholds
- **Recommendation:** Extract configuration constants to dedicated config files

#### 4. Mock Data Usage

**Severity: High**

- **Issue:** Extensive use of mock data in production code
- **Examples:**
  - `ebayClient.ts:39-56` - Entire function returns mock data
  - `DealCard.tsx:33-37` - Mock time calculation in component
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper API integrations and remove mock data from production builds

## Security Assessment

### Current Security Posture: **Medium Risk**

#### Strengths
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) implemented for user data
- Environment variables used for sensitive configuration
- Input validation present in some modules

#### Vulnerabilities and Concerns

1. **API Key Management**
   - **Severity: Medium**
   - **Issue:** No evidence of comprehensive secrets management strategy
   - **Recommendation:** Implement proper secrets rotation and validation

2. **Input Sanitization**
   - **Severity: Medium** 
   - **Issue:** Inconsistent input validation across the application
   - **Examples:** `normaliser.ts` processes raw titles without sanitization
   - **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive input sanitization layer

3. **Client-Side Data Exposure**
   - **Severity: Low**
   - **Issue:** Mock data contains realistic-looking URLs that could mislead users
   - **Recommendation:** Clearly mark mock data and implement proper data masking

## Performance Analysis

### Current Performance: **Fair**

#### Strengths
- React Query for efficient data caching
- Lazy loading with React Router
- Optimized build process with Vite

#### Performance Concerns

1. **Bundle Size**
   - Large number of Radix UI components imported
   - No evidence of code splitting beyond route level
   - **Recommendation:** Implement dynamic imports for heavy components

2. **Data Processing**
   - Complex regex operations in `normaliser.ts` could impact performance with large datasets
   - **Recommendation:** Consider memoization for expensive parsing operations

3. **Memory Leaks**
   - No evidence of cleanup in useEffect hooks
   - **Recommendation:** Audit all effects for proper cleanup

## Testing Coverage

### Current State: **Basic**

#### Existing Tests
- Unit tests for core business logic (`dealScore.test.ts`, `normaliser.test.ts`)
- Basic test setup with Vitest and React Testing Library

#### Testing Gaps

1. **Integration Testing**
   - No API integration tests
   - No end-to-end testing setup
   - Component integration not tested

2. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Error scenarios under-tested
   - Boundary conditions not covered
   - Mock data limits testing effectiveness

3. **Test Quality**
   - Tests rely heavily on mock data
   - No performance or load testing
   - Accessibility testing absent

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive testing strategy with integration tests, E2E tests using Playwright, and accessibility testing with axe-core.

## Architecture Assessment

### Strengths
- Clear domain boundaries following DDD principles
- Separation of concerns well-maintained
- Modular design facilitates testing and maintenance

### Architecture Concerns

1. **State Management**
   - Over-reliance on React Query for all state
   - No global state management for complex UI state
   - **Recommendation:** Consider Zustand or Context API for complex client state

2. **Data Layer**
   - Direct Supabase client usage throughout components
   - No repository pattern or data access abstraction
   - **Recommendation:** Implement repository pattern for better testability

3. **API Design**
   - Mock endpoints scattered throughout codebase
   - No clear API contract definitions
   - **Recommendation:** Implement OpenAPI schema and mock server

## Maintainability Score: 6.5/10

### Positive Factors
- Good TypeScript usage
- Clear file organization
- Comprehensive documentation in key files

### Maintenance Challenges
- High coupling between components and data layer
- Inconsistent patterns across codebase  
- Mock data makes debugging production issues difficult

## Recommendations by Priority

### High Priority
1. Replace mock data with real API integrations
2. Implement comprehensive error handling strategy
3. Add integration and E2E testing
4. Standardize code formatting and patterns

### Medium Priority  
1. Extract configuration constants
2. Implement repository pattern for data access
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Improve security posture with proper secrets management

### Low Priority
1. Optimize bundle size with better code splitting
2. Add accessibility testing
3. Implement comprehensive logging strategy
4. Add performance benchmarking

## Conclusion

The ComicScoutUK codebase demonstrates solid architectural foundations with good TypeScript usage and clear separation of concerns. However, it remains in prototype phase with extensive mock data usage and several areas requiring attention before production deployment. The code is maintainable but would benefit from standardization efforts and comprehensive testing strategy.

**Overall Rating: C+ (Functional prototype with room for improvement)**

The project shows promise but requires focused effort on removing mock dependencies, implementing proper testing, and standardizing development practices to achieve production readiness.
