# Code Audit Framework

This document defines the framework and criteria for auditing the ComicScout UK codebase. The goal is to identify risks, improve maintainability, and ensure alignment with architectural standards before initiating major refactoring.

## Audit Objectives

- Assess code quality and maintainability.
- Identify dead code, duplicated logic, and anti‑patterns.
- Evaluate dependency health and security vulnerabilities.
- Verify adherence to the architectural boundaries defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Provide actionable recommendations for refactoring.

## Scope

The audit covers all directories under `src/` and any scripts or configuration files that interact with the application. Third‑party libraries are reviewed at a high level to ensure they are up to date and maintained.

## Audit Checklist

1. **Project Structure**  
   - Does the folder structure follow a clear domain-oriented hierarchy?  
   - Are concerns such as data access, business logic, and presentation layers separated?

2. **Code Quality**  
   - Are functions and components small and focused on a single responsibility?  
   - Is there unnecessary duplication that could be abstracted?  
   - Do file and variable names convey intent?

3. **Error Handling & Logging**  
   - Are errors caught and logged appropriately?  
   - Is sensitive information avoided in logs?

4. **Dependency Management**  
   - Are dependencies declared explicitly in `package.json`?  
   - Are any dependencies outdated or vulnerable? Use tools like `npm audit` to check.

5. **State Management**  
   - Is state managed predictably (e.g., via React hooks or a dedicated store)?  
   - Are there side effects that could be isolated?

6. **API & Data Access**  
   - Are API calls abstracted into services or hooks?  
   - Is input validated and sanitized before use?

7. **Testing Coverage**  
   - Are there automated tests for critical components and functions?  
   - Is test coverage sufficient and meaningful, not just quantitative?

8. **Documentation & Comments**  
   - Are modules, functions, and complex blocks documented?  
   - Is there clear guidance on how to run and contribute to the project?

## Reporting Findings

For each issue discovered, provide:

- A brief description of the problem.  
- Its potential impact on functionality, security, or maintainability.  
- Suggested remediation steps and effort estimate.

Compile findings into an audit report and attach it to the refactoring plan to guide prioritisation.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- **Auditor:** Conducts the code review, compiles findings, and proposes remediation.  
- **Maintainers:** Review and accept audit findings, prioritise fixes, and integrate them into the refactor backlog.  
- **Team Lead:** Ensures the audit is completed and that remedial actions are scheduled.
