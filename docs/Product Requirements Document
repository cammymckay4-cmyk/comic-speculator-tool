Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project: ComicScoutUK
Version: 1.0 (Refactor)
Goal: To transform an existing repository into a robust, market-ready application for UK comic collectors and speculators.
________________________________________
1. Introduction & Vision
•	Vision: To be the essential digital tool for UK comic collectors and speculators, combining personal collection management with powerful, data-driven market analysis and live eBay integration.
•	Core Mission: To fill a clear gap in the UK market by providing collectors with the fastest, most direct way to find, track, and be notified about specific comics for sale on eBay.
•	Unique Selling Proposition (USP): A powerful scouting tool that provides proactive, real-time alerts and ranks eBay listings by "best deal," eliminating the need for constant manual searching.

2. Core Architectural Principles
•	Decoupled Architecture: The backend will function as a standalone REST API. This ensures the frontend is completely interchangeable, allowing the user's custom-built frontend to replace any basic placeholder UI.
•	eBay ToS Compliance: All features displaying market listings will link directly back to eBay to ensure compliance with their Terms of Service.
•	Preservation of Critical Integrations: The existing, verified Resend email integration will be preserved and integrated into the new architecture.

3. Target Audience
•	The Speculator/Investor: Needs robust market data, value trends, portfolio analysis, and "sell" alerts to maximize ROI.
•	The Dedicated Collector: Needs a powerful wishlist and alert system to find specific comics to complete their collection, often with specific grade requirements.
•	The Casual Hobbyist: Needs easy-to-use tools to catalogue their collection and explore the market.
