# Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the tasks and priorities for the initial refactor of ComicScout UK. The goal is to clean up the existing codebase, document the current architecture and prepare the project for further development. The plan is based on the high‑level steps defined in Phase 1 of the refactoring transcript.

## Phase 1 – Analysis & Cleanup

1. **Establish core project documentation** – Rewrite the `README.md` to clarify the project vision, mission and current status. Introduce key features and the target architecture.
2. **Create a refactoring plan** – Produce this `REFACTORING_PLAN.md` summarising all work to be done in Phase 1 and establishing placeholders for later phases.
3. **Document the architecture** – Add a comprehensive `ARCHITECTURE.md` describing system design, domain boundaries, data flow, draft database schema and external integrations.
4. **Remove obsolete planning files** – Delete `planning.md` or any old design notes that are no longer relevant to the refactor.
5. **Configure package.json** – Create or update `package.json` with the appropriate dependencies, scripts and metadata for a modern Node/Next.js project.
6. **Create `.env.example`** – Provide an example environment file listing the necessary environment variables (API keys, database URLs, etc.) without sensitive data.
7. **Update `.gitignore`** – Ensure the git ignore file excludes environment files, build artifacts and other generated files.
8. **Prepare migration plan** – Draft a `MIGRATION_PREP.md` document outlining how to migrate the existing database and services to the new architecture.
9. **Audit the existing codebase** – Produce an `AUDIT.md` that lists current scripts, components and services with commentary on what should be refactored, removed or improved.

## Future Phases

Subsequent phases will involve implementing the new service modules, integrating with real data sources, building the API and user interface, adding automated tests and deploying the production system. Details will be added to this plan as they are developed.
