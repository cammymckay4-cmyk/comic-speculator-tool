# Obsolete Files Cleanup Summary

This file records the cleanup of obsolete planning and brainstorming files as part of Phase 1 of the ComicScout UK refactoring project.

After reviewing the repository, we found that there were no outdated planning or brainstorming files or directories (e.g., `planning/`, `docs/old/`, `NOTES.md`, `TODO.md`, `BRAINSTORM.md`, `IDEAS.txt`, `scratch.md`, `temp/`, `.old/`, `backup/`, `archive/`, `TOP_DEALS_API.md`) present in the current codebase. Therefore, this branch does not introduce any file deletions, but serves as documentation that the cleanup task has been addressed.
