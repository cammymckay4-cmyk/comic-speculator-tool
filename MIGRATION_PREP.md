# Migration Preparation

This document outlines the steps needed to prepare for database schema migrations as we evolve the ComicScout UK application. Migrations ensure that changes to the underlying data models are applied systematically across development, staging, and production environments without data loss.

## Objectives

- Define a repeatable process to apply schema changes.
- Ensure data integrity before, during, and after migrations.
- Align the team on migration responsibilities and timelines.

## Preparation Steps

1. **Baseline Capture**  
   - Export the current database schema using `pg_dump` or a similar tool.  
   - Document existing tables, indices, and constraints in the architecture docs.

2. **Schema Versioning**  
   - Adopt a versioning tool such as `Prisma Migrate` or `Knex` migration scripts.  
   - Create an initial migration script that reflects the baseline schema.

3. **Backup Strategy**  
   - Before applying new migrations, take a full backup of the production database.  
   - Verify that backups can be restored in a staging environment.

4. **Environment Configuration**  
   - Ensure all `.env` files include connection strings for development, staging, and production.  
   - Use environment variables rather than hard-coded credentials.

5. **Testing Migrations**  
   - Run migration scripts against a local copy of the production data to identify any issues.  
   - Validate that the application functions as expected after migration.

6. **Deployment Plan**  
   - Schedule migration windows during periods of low traffic.  
   - Communicate downtime expectations to stakeholders if required.

7. **Rollback Procedures**  
   - Prepare rollback scripts or maintain a migration history to revert to the previous schema.  
   - Test rollback procedures in staging to ensure they work reliably.

## Responsibilities

- **Developers:** Draft migration scripts, review them for accuracy, and test locally.  
- **DevOps / Operations:** Manage backups, staging, and production environment variables.  
- **Project Lead:** Approve migration plans and coordinate deployment windows.
