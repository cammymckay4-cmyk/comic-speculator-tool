**Debt Level:** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**  
**Affected Files:** `src/lib/ebayClient.ts`, `src/components/DealCard.tsx`, API integration points  
**Impact:** High - Prevents production deployment  

#### Description
Extensive use of mock data throughout the codebase creates a false sense of functionality and blocks real user testing.

#### Specific Instances
- `ebayClient.ts:30-67` - `fetchLiveListings()` returns only mock data
- `ebayClient.ts:78-133` - `fetchSoldListings()` entirely mocked  
- `DealCard.tsx:32-37` - Mock time remaining calculation
- Test fixtures used in place of real API responses

#### Technical Impact
- Cannot validate real API integrations
- Performance characteristics unknown
- Error handling untested with real data
- User acceptance testing impossible

#### Remediation Strategy
1. **Phase 1:** Implement eBay API integration with real endpoints
2. **Phase 2:** Add feature flags to toggle between mock/real data
3. **Phase 3:** Remove mock data entirely from production builds
4. **Phase 4:** Update tests to use proper mocking frameworks

**Estimated Effort:** 15-20 developer days  
**Business Risk:** High - blocks go-live
